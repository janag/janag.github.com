Imagine JavasScript on server side
It's easy if you try Node.js
No (b)locking hell below us
Above us only node modules

Imagine your app never sleeps
It isn't hard to do if you try Node.js
Nothing to (b)lock or wait for  

Imagine all the people sharing
I wonder if you can
It is easy if you try GitHub
Just clone and try Node.js

Imagine Node.js running in all OS
And Microsoft Windows too
It isn't hard to do if you try 

Imagine JavaScript without bad parts
I wonder if you can
It isn't hard to do if you try CoffeeScript

You may say 
I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And you will never go back
